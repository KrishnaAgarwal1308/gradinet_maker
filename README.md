Gradient Decent is the backbone of any ml training.
This repository shows how gradient decent works under the hood in pytorch or any other framework.

It doesnot requires any fancy framework here to run and understand the code. It just requires prior knowledge of high school level calculus and a good understanding of python(OOPs).
