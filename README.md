# Gradient Maker

Gradient Maker is a lightweight implementation demonstrating the core principles of gradient descentâ€”one of the most essential algorithms in machine learning. This repository is designed to help users understand how gradient descent works under the hood without relying on heavy frameworks.

---

## Overview

Gradient descent is the backbone of machine learning training. This project uses a simple Python implementation to illustrate the concepts behind gradient descent by leveraging a graph-based approach to store and propagate gradients through computational nodes.

---

## Features

- **Simple and Clear Code**: Understand gradient descent without the complexity of advanced frameworks.
- **Graph-based Gradient Storage**: Visualize the relationship between variables during computation.
- **Educational Example**: Train a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on an easy-to-visualize dataset.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Requires only basic Python knowledge and high school level calculus.

## Repository Structure

- **`nn.py`**: Contains an example of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that trains on a simple dataset.
- **`gradient_maker.py`**: Defines classes and functions to implement gradient descent using a computational graph.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and usage instructions.
- **`.gitignore`**: Lists files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## How to Use

### Running the MLP Example

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrishnaAgarwal1308/gradinet_maker.git
   cd gradinet_maker
   python nn.py
   ```
## Customizing Gradient Descent
Feel free to modify the code in gradient_maker.py to experiment with different functions, gradient computations, or integrate more complex models. The modular design makes it an excellent starting point for learning and experimentation.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

Basic Python Knowledge: Understanding object-oriented programming in Python will help.

High School Level Calculus: Familiarity with basic calculus concepts such as derivatives is recommended.
